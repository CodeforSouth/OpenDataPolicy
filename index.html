        </h2>
        <section>
            <p>Open data refers to data (such as documents, databases, records, or transcripts, including those managed by outside vendors) released by a government or organization that is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>freely available</strong> to be used, shared, and reused by anyone for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.</li>
                <li><strong>available in digital, machine-readable formats</strong> (such as .csv) so that it can be used in combination with other data and applications.</li>
                <li><strong>available in its entirety</strong> — and able to be downloaded “in bulk” and not just manually retrieved record-by-record.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How much will it cost?</h2>
            <p>"There has been a range of budgeted numbers attached to legislation for funding open data efforts. Generally, anywhere from $0 (if no one is hired and no additional money is needed for technology) to $500,000 (for hiring new staff and adopting new technology) may be budgeted for city, state, or federal open data initiatives. Funding should be considered for—but not limited to—the potential of new staff (administrative, technical and legal), new software (to house, extract and input data), training, and server maintenance. It will be important for each jurisdiction to consider what it needs to support a strong open data ecosystem."</p>
